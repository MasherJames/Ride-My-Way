# Ride-My-Way

Ride-my-way App is a carpooling application that provides drivers with the ability to create ride offers
and passengers to join available ride offers.

**How it works**

- A driver creates an account and logs in
- The driver creates ride offers
- A passenger creates an account and logs in
- A passenger is able to view all available ride offers and can request to join
- The driver accepts or rejects the request from the passenger
- The passenger is notified about the response
